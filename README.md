Client-only Youtube content management, this is a Work in Progress that never gets enough time to get done. Originally started as a basic jQuery/Dropzone client, was converted to React, then designed to look like the new Channel Manager, then convert(ing) to TypeScript.

In a past experience, all examples I could find of the Google YouTube API were server-side supporting languages like PHP, Java, C#.  It didnt make sense to me that one would upload videos to their own server before sending it to Google's servers, so I wanted to eliminate that bottleneck.  Especially helpful when uploading large video files.

That problem may have changed in recent years, but I liked this project. So I re-did an old jQuery project into modern React with Typescript.

### Getting Started
- Create Firebase Project
- Create Google Console Project (the above created firebase project should appear at time of writing this doc)
    - https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/start.md#setup
    - Browser key was auto generated by firebase!


### To-Do 
- Restrict GAPI API KEY found in Console
- Finish user drop-down menu 
- Auto-save input values and send to youtube api
- Tagging
- Custom thumbnail upload
- Add progress spinner in place of template image
- Helper function that stores youtube metadata in your own database
- Replace Dropzone with React Drag and Drop
